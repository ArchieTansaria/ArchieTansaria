<p align="center">full-stack dev • design enjoyer • tinkering with systems & security</p>

### 👨‍💻 about me  
- I build full-stack products (sometimes small, sometimes ambitious)  
- I care about clean design and developer experience  
- I explore systems / OS concepts + security in my free time  
- I love understanding how things work under the hood  
- always learning, always building

### 📂 featured work  
_(my pinned repos are the best place to start — more coming as I build in public)_  

- **Full-Stack Projects** — real products & experiments  
- **Design-Forward UIs** — dashboards, components, layouts  
- **Systems & Security Experiments** — low-level scripts & tools  
- **Notes & Learning** — OS internals, networking, dev docs

---

### 🚀 what I'm doing now  
- building projects publicly  
- sharpening full-stack + design skills  
- exploring system internals (processes, memory, I/O…)  
- learning practical security concepts  

---

### 🌱 currently learning  
- backend architecture  
- OS fundamentals  
- modern frontend patterns  
- how to build better things faster

### 💬 connect with me  
If you’re a builder, designer, or just someone who loves tech — my DMs are open.  
Always down to talk about ideas, systems, or something you’re building.
